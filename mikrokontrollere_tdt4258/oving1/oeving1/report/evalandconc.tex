\section{Evaluation of assignment}


GNU tools are really helpful in programming and debugging. Assembly is tedious work and unsuited for more complex tasks. We have learned how to program the basics of a STK1000 and AVR32 based microcontroller, and also to always run all tests again when we alter the code to fix a bug. \\

Our experience with the assignment was very good, and we learned a lot of the nescessary skills to continue on to the next assignment. We learned how to look up instructions and settings in the datasheets, how to use the debugger and basic usage of the hardware. The compendium was also immensely helpful, with a good balance of plain hints, relevant information and tutorials (eg. the GNU debugger).


\section{Conclusion}

The program works as expected, except for a bug when pressing and holding both buttons, and can be debugged using GNU. It does still waste a few cycles doing useless work, but there is no other work to do, so this isn’t a problem. Debugging revealed some flaws in the code, albeit we figured it out a bit late to fix it. This is because some tests were performed before the final alterations to the code were made. These alterations were  made to correct bugs, but introduced new bugs that were not tested for. For future projects, we will rerun all tests when altering the code.
