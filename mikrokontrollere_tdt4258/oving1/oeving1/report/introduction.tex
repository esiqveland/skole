\section{Introduction}
The goal of this exercise was to learn about the STK1000 and the AVR-32 and how develop assembly code for these using GNU tools. To do this we made assembly code to paddle a led light by pressing one of two buttons. The main loop of the program just sleeps, as this is intended to be “everything else the computer does”, and therefore the interrupt routine handles the entire job of reading the input and setting the lights. As there are no other programs running however, we have not written any code to save registers and restore these to their original state upon the return of the interrupt. The program works when more than one button is pressed and loops around when the light reaches led 1 or led 8 and is moved to the right and left respectively. It is also possible to debug the program while it is running on the STK1000 using the GNU debugger.
